# genetic-algorithm

source files: src/genetic_algorithm/*

An implementation of a genetic algorithm to find the shortest distance between points on an xy graph. If you're feeling fancy we can call the points cities and the order of the vector holding the cities the route to take, then this algorithm is approximating a solution to the travelling salesmen problem.

## Installation

Clone / download git repo, compile with leiningen.

## Usage

    $ java -jar genetic-algorithm-0.1.0-standalone.jar [number-of-processes number-of-cycles fit-population-max]
